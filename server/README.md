# RethinkSoft in Chrome â€” MCP Server

The MCP server exposes browser tools to MCP clients and forwards browser work to
the Chrome extension over the local WebSocket relay.

## Setup

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

Add to your MCP config (e.g., `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/rethinksoft-in-chrome/mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Prerequisites:** The Chrome extension must be installed and running. See the [main README](../README.md) for full setup.

## How It Works

```text
MCP client
  -> mcp-server (stdio)
  -> relay (WebSocket)
  -> Chrome extension
  -> browser agent
```

The extension is the browser executor. The MCP server should only manage MCP
tool calls, local session bookkeeping, and blocking waits for completion.

## Tools

### `browser_start`

Start a browser task. **Blocks until complete or timeout**.

```
browser_start(
  task: "Search for flights to Tokyo on Google Flights",
  url: "https://flights.google.com",        // optional starting URL
  context: "Departing March 15, economy"     // optional extra info
)

â†’ {
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "status": "complete",
  "task": "Search for flights to Tokyo...",
  "answer": "Found 3 flights: JAL $850, ANA $920, United $780",
  "total_steps": 8,
  "recent_steps": ["Opened Google Flights", "Set destination to Tokyo", ...]
}
```

### `browser_message`

Send follow-up instructions to an existing session. Also blocks until the agent finishes.

```
browser_message(session_id: "abc123", message: "Book the cheapest one")
```

### `browser_status`

Check known sessions and their latest status.

```
browser_status()                    // all active sessions
browser_status(session_id: "abc123") // specific session
```

### `browser_stop`

Stop a task.

```
browser_stop(session_id: "abc123")
browser_stop(session_id: "abc123", remove: true)  // also delete session
```

### `browser_screenshot`

Capture the current browser state as an image.

```
browser_screenshot(session_id: "abc123")
```

## Examples

**Research:**
```
browser_start("Find the top 3 competitors for Acme Corp and summarize their pricing")
```

**Logged-in workflows:**
```
browser_start("Go to Jira, find my open tickets, and summarize what needs attention this week")
```

**Multi-turn:**
```
s = browser_start("Go to LinkedIn and find AI Engineer jobs in Montreal")
â†’ { session_id: "x1", answer: "Found: Applied AI Engineer at Cohere" }

browser_message("x1", "Click into that job and tell me the requirements")
â†’ { answer: "Requirements: 3+ years Python, ML experience..." }

browser_message("x1", "Apply to this job using my profile")
â†’ { answer: "Application submitted successfully" }
```

**Parallel execution:**
```
browser_start("Check flight prices to Tokyo")
browser_start("Check hotel prices in Shibuya")
browser_start("Look up train pass costs")
// All three run simultaneously
```

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HANZI_IN_CHROME_MAX_SESSIONS` | `5` | Max concurrent browser tasks |
| `WS_RELAY_PORT` | `7862` | WebSocket relay port |

## Architecture

```
AI Tool (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
    â†“ MCP Protocol (stdio)
MCP Server
    â†“ WebSocket
Relay Server
    â†“ WebSocket
Chrome Extension
    â†“ Extension agent loop
Target Website
```

The relay server starts automatically when the MCP server connects. It routes
messages between the MCP server and the Chrome extension and briefly queues
messages while the extension service worker is asleep.

> **Principle**: RethinkSoft is for real browser work in your signed-in Chrome.
> Agents should prefer code, logs, APIs, and existing tools first. Use RethinkSoft when the job needs a real browser session.

## Prompts

The server exposes MCP prompts that clients auto-discover as slash commands:

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `linkedin-prospector` | Goal-driven LinkedIn outreach â€” networking, sales, partnerships, or hiring |
| `e2e-tester` | Test your app in a real browser â€” reports bugs with screenshots and code references |
| `social-poster` | Post across LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit, HN â€” drafts per-platform, posts from your browser |

In Claude Code, use the built-in `linkedin-prospector` prompt from the MCP prompt list.

## Skills CLI

```bash
rethinksoft-browser skills                              # list available skills
rethinksoft-browser skills install linkedin-prospector   # install SKILL.md to your project
```

Skills are portable SKILL.md files for agents that don't support MCP prompts (Cline, Codex). Each skill follows the same principle: use existing tools first, RethinkSoft only for real browser steps.
