- Connection request: go to their profile, click 'Connect' button, optionally add a note
- Once connected, use the 'Message' button on their profile or go to Messaging tab
- InMail (messaging non-connections) requires Premium subscription

## Easy Apply Forms
- Contact Info page is pre-filled from LinkedIn profile - don't try to modify, just click Next
- Modal forms may need scrolling to see all content and buttons
- Use screenshots over read_page for modals - accessibility tree often misses modal content

## Navigation
- Main tabs: Home (feed), My Network, Jobs, Messaging, Notifications
- Job search: Jobs tab → filter by location, experience level, date posted
- 'Easy Apply' = apply within LinkedIn; 'Apply' = external site
- Profile sections are collapsible - click 'Show all' to expand`

## CRITICAL: Reply Textbox Handling
- The reply/compose box is a CONTENTEDITABLE div, not a regular input
- You MUST click inside the textbox FIRST to focus it, THEN type your message
- If text doesn't appear, click the textbox again and retry typing
- After typing your message, click the blue "Reply" or "Post" button IMMEDIATELY
- Don't overthink - once you've typed the message, just click Reply!

## Replying to Tweets (Most Common Task)
- To find someone's tweets quickly: use search with "from:username" (e.g., from:elonmusk)
- DON'T endlessly scroll looking for the "perfect" tweet - pick a relevant one and reply
- Click the speech bubble (💬) icon below a tweet to open the reply composer
- Type your reply, then click the blue "Reply" button - be decisive!
- The reply will appear as a thread under the original tweet

## Posting & Composing
- Compose new post: click the blue "Post" button in sidebar (desktop) or floating button (mobile)
- The pencil/compose icon opens PUBLIC post composer, NOT direct messages
- Below each post: reply (speech bubble), repost (arrows), like (heart), share icons

## Direct Messages (DMs)
- To DM: go to user's PROFILE page, look for "Message" button next to Follow
- If no Message button visible: user has DMs disabled OR you need Twitter Premium to DM non-followers
- DO NOT use the compose/pencil button for DMs - that's for public posts only
- The Messages icon in sidebar shows existing conversations, not for starting new DMs with non-contacts

## Navigation & Search
- Profile: click on username or profile picture
- Search operators: 'from:username' (their tweets), 'to:username' (replies to them)
- Use search URL directly: x.com/search?q=from:username&f=live for recent tweets
- Timeline shows posts in feed - but search is faster for finding specific user's content`

## Dropout Process
- Dropping out requires completing prerequisite tasks first (e.g., dropping classes, paying balances)
- If you see "Not Yet Eligible" or similar warnings, you MUST complete the required steps first
- Check if buttons are disabled before clicking - don't assume buttons will work
- Look for checklists or status indicators showing what needs to be done
- Complete all required tasks before attempting the final dropout action

## Anti-Bot Challenges on This Site:

This site has multiple anti-bot mechanisms. Here's how to handle each:

### 1. Mouse Tracking (Login/Registration)
- Login and registration pages track mouse movements (count and total distance)
- This is handled automatically - our clicks include simulated mouse movement
- No special action needed

### 1b. Dropout Page Activity Verification
The dropout form has strict activity thresholds you MUST meet before submitting:

**"Demonstrate activity" requires:**
- 75+ mouse movements (each 5-500px distance)
- 20+ direction changes (sharp turns >45°)

**"Navigate erratically" requires:**
- 15+ total keystrokes
- 8+ unique keys pressed

**EXACT FLOW TO ENABLE NEXT BUTTON:**
1. Select a dropout reason FIRST (required before countdown starts)
2. Use javascript_tool to simulate activity:
\`\`\`javascript
// Simulate mouse movements with direction changes
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  const angle = (i % 4) * 90; // Change direction every move
  const x = 400 + Math.cos(angle * Math.PI/180) * 50;
  const y = 300 + Math.sin(angle * Math.PI/180) * 50;
  window.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('mousemove', {clientX: x, clientY: y, bubbles: true}));
}
// Simulate keystrokes with unique keys
'abcdefghijklmnop'.split('').forEach(key => {
  window.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent('keydown', {key, bubbles: true}));
});
\`\`\`
3. Once ALL thresholds are met AND reason is selected, a 10-second countdown starts automatically
4. **CRITICAL: You MUST continue showing activity DURING the countdown** - dispatch at least one mouse/keyboard event during this time
5. Only after countdown completes WITH activity during it, the Next button enables

**Why this matters:** The countdown sets a flag, but a SEPARATE flag for "activity during countdown" must also be true. Without activity during the 10 seconds, the button stays disabled even after countdown.

### 1c. Dropout Popup Challenges
After activity verification, 8 random popup modals appear. You must solve ALL of them.

**Quick bypass**: \`localStorage.setItem("skip_popups", "true")\` skips all popups.

**Manual solutions for each popup type:**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **ssn-input** | Type "nice try" (or any 9 digits) |
| **robot-check** | Click the "Verify" button (don't answer the philosophical question) |
| **wait-timer** | Click Start, wait for progress bar to reach 100%, then Submit |
| **button-mash** | Press 5+ different keys while focused on the popup |
| **dodgy-close** | Click the moving X button 3 times, then click it again to close |
| **newsletter** | Type "unsubscribe" in the input field |
| **terms-conditions** | Scroll to bottom of text, check the accept box, then Submit |
| **email-verify** | Type "VERIFY" (uppercase) in the input |
| **browser-update** | Check the acknowledge checkbox, then click Update |
| **country-select** | Select a country, then state, then city from dropdowns |
| **iframe-survey** | Check the checkbox inside the iframe |
| **overlapping-buttons** | One button is correct (random) - try each until one works |

### 2. Bouncing Slider Modal ("Confirm Payment" / "결제 확인")
- A modal appears that BOUNCES around the screen
- Normal clicks won't work because the modal moves before the click lands
- **Solution**: Use javascript_tool to dispatch mouse events directly:

\`\`\`javascript
javascript_tool with action='javascript_exec' and text:

const handle = document.querySelector('.slider-handle');
if (handle) {
  const rect = handle.getBoundingClientRect();
  const startX = rect.left + rect.width / 2;
  const startY = rect.top + rect.height / 2;

  // Mousedown stops the bouncing
  handle.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('mousedown', {bubbles: true, cancelable: true, clientX: startX, clientY: startY}));

  // Drag to the right
  setTimeout(() => {
    document.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('mousemove', {bubbles: true, cancelable: true, clientX: startX + 300, clientY: startY}));
    setTimeout(() => {
      document.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('mouseup', {bubbles: true, cancelable: true, clientX: startX + 300, clientY: startY}));
    }, 100);
  }, 50);

  'Slider solved - mousedown stops bouncing, then drag completes it';
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Number Sequence CAPTCHA ("Click numbers in order: X → Y → Z")
- Read the sequence from the page (e.g., "8 → 3 → 7")
- Click the buttons in that exact order
- Buttons are labeled 1-9, just click them in the specified sequence

### 4. Image CAPTCHAs

**On /dropout page ONLY - use solve_captcha tool:**
- Just call: solve_captcha(tabId)
- The tool brute forces correct images and calls the dropout API directly
- Wait for page to reload after success
- If 401 error: Session expired - log in again
- If entropy error: Complete more activity on the form first

**On OTHER pages (payment, etc.) - solve visually:**
- solve_captcha does NOT work outside /dropout (it would break the CAPTCHA)
- Take a screenshot to see the images clearly
- Read the category carefully (e.g., "Select all logos", "Select the sun")
- Click the correct images based on what you see
- **BEFORE clicking Verify**: Take another screenshot to confirm your selections look correct
- Check that selected images have a visible border/highlight
- Only then click Verify

**"Select the sun" hint:** "Sun" might be a person's name - look for images of people/humans
**"Select logos" hint:** Look for Deck logo (overlapping rectangles) or Concordia logo

### 5. Form Token Expiration
- Form tokens expire quickly
- Complete forms promptly after they load
- If you get "Invalid or expired form token", refresh and try again faster

### 5b. Session Expiration
- Sessions can expire unexpectedly - you may find yourself back at the login page
- If this happens, log in again using your credentials

### 6. Popup Windows (Payment, Verification, etc.)
- Some actions open a NEW POPUP WINDOW instead of showing content inline
- Signs a popup opened: "Complete Payment in Popup Window", "A secure payment window has been opened", loading spinner that doesn't resolve
- **CRITICAL**: When you see these signs, you MUST:
  1. Use \`tabs_context\` tool to list all open tabs
  2. Find the new popup tab (usually the most recent tab, or one with payment/verification URL)
  3. Switch to that tab by using its tabId in subsequent tool calls
  4. Complete the action in the popup
  5. Use \`tabs_close\` tool to close the popup when done, or if session expires
- **DO NOT** navigate away from the current page or go to a different URL when waiting for a popup
- **DO NOT** assume a popup closed just because a button click said "Close Window" - use \`tabs_close\` to actually close it
- **DO NOT** assume the popup failed just because the main page shows a waiting message

## General Debugging Approach

If you encounter a new anti-bot challenge:
1. Use javascript_tool to fetch and inspect the site's JS:
   \`fetch('URL').then(r => r.text()).then(code => { /* analyze */ })\`
2. Look for event listeners, timers, or tracking mechanisms
3. Craft a solution using javascript_tool to dispatch events or modify state directly`
